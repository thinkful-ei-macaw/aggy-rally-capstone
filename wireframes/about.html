        <p>We are dedicated to fostering the growth and ease of access to Tabletop Roleplaying Games. Our goal is to make finding a group simple and effective, while focusing
            on matching potential players by key factors such as; Availability, Game-type preferences, Preferred length of session, Favorite System, and more. Anyone who 
            Roleplays regularly knows that the most common way for a campaign to end is by the game falling apart, rather than having a proper end. It is our belief that
            by syncing up players who have similar expectations from a game at its onset that the game will be healthier.
